# Titanic Best-Fit Model

This project explores the Titanic dataset to determine the best-fitting machine learning model for predicting passenger survival. It includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and transformation
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance comparison to find the most accurate model
